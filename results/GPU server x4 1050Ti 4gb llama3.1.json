    "response": "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it consists of all the colors of the visible spectrum, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n2. **Molecules scatter the light**: The tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) in the air scatter the sunlight as it passes through them. This scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, than for longer wavelengths, like red and orange.\n3. **Blue light scatters in all directions**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed in all directions throughout the atmosphere. This means that when we look up at the sky, our eyes are seeing the scattered blue light from all around us.\n4. **Our eyes perceive the scattered blue light**: Because of its shorter wavelength and greater scattering effect, our eyes perceive the blue light as the dominant color of the sky. The scattered blue light reaches our eyes directly from the atmosphere, giving the sky its characteristic blue hue.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. It's worth noting that the exact shade of blue we see can vary depending on factors like atmospheric conditions, time of day, and pollution levels.\n\nNow, next time you gaze up at a clear blue sky, remember the tiny molecules dancing in the air, scattering light and making our world a more beautiful place!",
