    "response": "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions.\n\nHowever, they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. As a result, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere and reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky, giving it its blue appearance.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: The sun emits a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light.\n2.  **Light interacts with atmospheric gases**: When sunlight encounters molecules in the atmosphere (such as N2 and O2), they scatter the light in all directions.\n3.  **Scattering favors shorter wavelengths**: The scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter (blue) wavelengths than longer (red) wavelengths. This means that blue light is scattered more efficiently than red light.\n4.  **Blue light reaches our eyes**: As a result of this scattering, the sky appears blue to us because we see all parts of it from an angle where blue light dominates.\n\nThe color of the sky can change under different conditions:\n\n*   **During sunrise and sunset**, the sky often takes on hues of red, orange, or pink. This is due to the longer path that light travels through the atmosphere at these times.\n*   **At night**, the sky appears dark because there are no direct sources of visible light illuminating it.\n\nThe exact shade of blue can also vary depending on factors like atmospheric conditions and pollution levels.\n\nScattering is just one aspect of how light interacts with matter. It's a fascinating topic that has been extensively studied in various fields, including physics, chemistry, and astronomy.",
