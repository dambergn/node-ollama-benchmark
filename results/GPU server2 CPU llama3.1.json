    "response": "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight and Atmospheric Interaction**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions.\n2. **Wavelength and Scattering**: Different wavelengths of light are scattered to varying degrees by these gas molecules. Blue light, with its shorter wavelength, is scattered more than other colors because it interacts with the smaller air molecules more effectively.\n3. **Blue Light Dominance**: As a result of this scattering, our atmosphere absorbs most of the blue light from the sun and scatters it in all directions towards us. This makes the sky appear blue when we look up at it.\n4. **Other Colors Present but Not Visible**: While blue is the dominant color in the scattered sunlight, other colors like red, orange, and green are also present but not as visible to our eyes because they're either absorbed or scattered less effectively.\n\nThis explanation is a simplified version of Rayleigh scattering theory. Keep in mind that while Rayleigh scattering is responsible for the overall blue appearance of the sky during the day, factors such as pollution (which can scatter shorter wavelengths like blue and violet more than longer ones), dust particles in the air, and even the presence of aerosols can modify the exact shade or hue we observe.\n\nSo, to summarize: The sky appears blue because the tiny molecules of gases in our atmosphere scatter sunlight, with shorter wavelength blue light being scattered the most.",
