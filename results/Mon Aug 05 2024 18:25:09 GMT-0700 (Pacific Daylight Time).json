  "response": "The sky appears blue to us during the day due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight and Atmosphere**: Sunlight, or solar radiation, is made up of a spectrum of colors that, combined, look white to our eyes. When this sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules of nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), along with other gases.\n\n2. **Scattering of Light**: These gas molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it in the 19th century.\n\n3. **Perception of Blue Sky**: The blue light is scattered in all directions and reaches our eyes from every part of the sky. Since we see more blue light than any other color, the sky appears blue to us during a clear day.\n\n4. **Variations in Appearance**: The exact shade of blue can vary under different conditions. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange due to a different scattering effect involving dust particles and water vapor in the atmosphere, known as Mie scattering. In this case, the light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, which scatters the shorter wavelengths (like blue) out of the line of sight, leaving mainly longer wavelengths (like red and orange) to reach our eyes.\n\nIn summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric molecules, with a greater effect on the shorter wavelengths of light, like blue.",
