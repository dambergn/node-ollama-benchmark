    "response": "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called scattering. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight**: The sun emits all kinds of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, which we see as white.\n2. **Air molecules**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n3. **Scattering**: As sunlight hits these air molecules, it scatters in all directions. This scattering is more efficient for shorter (blue) wavelengths than longer (red) wavelengths.\n4. **Blue light dominates**: Because blue light is scattered more effectively, it reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky, giving the sky its blue appearance. The blue color we see is actually a combination of the direct sunlight and the scattered blue light.\n\nThis explanation is often referred to as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described this phenomenon in 1871.\n\n**Why not violet?**: You might wonder why the sky doesn't appear violet instead of blue. There are two reasons for this:\n\t* Violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue light, which means it is scattered more intensely by air molecules.\n\t* However, violet light is also absorbed more efficiently by water and other atmospheric gases, reducing its intensity and making blue the dominant color we see.\n\n**Daylight vs. twilight**: During the day, when the sun is high in the sky, the amount of scattered blue light that reaches our eyes is greater than at sunrise or sunset, when the sun's rays have to travel through more atmosphere before reaching us. This is why the sky often appears less intense and more muted during these times.\n\nThere you have it! The next time someone asks you about the color of the sky, you'll be ready with a clear (pun intended) explanation.",
