    "response": "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: The sun emits a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. When this light enters our atmosphere, it encounters various types of molecules, such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n2. **Scattering occurs**: These molecules are too small to block the light, but they can scatter it in different directions. This scattering is more pronounced for shorter (blue) wavelengths than longer (red) wavelengths.\n3. **Blue light is scattered more**: The tiny molecules in the atmosphere are much more effective at scattering blue light than other colors. This is because blue light has a shorter wavelength and interacts with the molecular bonds of nitrogen and oxygen molecules in a way that scatters them preferentially.\n4. **Our eyes see the blue sky**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions. Our brain processes this scattered light as the color we perceive as blue.\n\nThe exact shade of blue can vary depending on factors such as:\n\n* Time of day: During sunrise and sunset, the sky appears more red because the sunlight has to travel through a longer distance in the atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) more.\n* Atmospheric conditions: Pollution, dust, and water vapor in the air can scatter light in different ways, affecting the apparent color of the sky.\n* Observer's location: The Earth's atmospheric conditions vary by latitude and altitude, influencing the perceived color of the sky.\n\nIn summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths (like blue) being scattered more than longer wavelengths.",
